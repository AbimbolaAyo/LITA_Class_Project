# LITA_Class_Project

This is where I documented my first project while learning data analysis with the Incubator Hub.

### Project Title: Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

The Sales Analysis project aims to explore and understand sales data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can drive better business decisions. The analysis covers various aspects such as sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and geographic distribution. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive understanding of their sales data.

### Data Sources

The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site.
