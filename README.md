This is where I documented my first project while learning data analysis with the Incubator Hub.

The Sales Analysis project aims to explore and understand sales data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can drive better business decisions. The analysis covers various aspects such as sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and geographic distribution. The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive understanding of their sales data.
